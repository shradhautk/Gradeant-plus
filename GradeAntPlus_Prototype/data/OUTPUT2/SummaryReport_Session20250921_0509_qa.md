## Learning Journey Overview
This session consisted of two physics questions covering kinematics and capacitance. The student demonstrated proficiency with the capacitance problem but struggled with the kinematics question, specifically with the units of acceleration. The session highlighted a need for reinforcement in understanding units and applying formulas correctly.

## Physics Concepts & Formulas Mastered
Key concepts covered include: 
1. **Uniform acceleration:** Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity. Formula: a = (v - u) / t, where 'a' is acceleration, 'v' is final velocity, 'u' is initial velocity, and 't' is time. Application: Calculating acceleration given initial and final velocities and the time interval.
2. **Capacitance:** The ability of a capacitor to store electric charge. Formula: Q = C * V, where 'Q' is charge, 'C' is capacitance, and 'V' is voltage. Application: Determining the charge stored in a capacitor given its capacitance and voltage.
Conceptual Relationship: Understanding that acceleration relates to how velocity changes over time is crucial in kinematics. Similarly, understanding how capacitance, voltage, and charge are interrelated is essential for circuit analysis.
Difficulty Level: The student found the kinematics problem more challenging due to the unit-related error.

## Conceptual Breakthroughs & Misconceptions Resolved
The main misconception was the incorrect units for acceleration. The student stated acceleration in m/s^3 instead of m/s^2. The root cause appeared to be a misunderstanding of the definition of acceleration as the rate of change of velocity. Corrective strategies included prompting the student to check the units and relating acceleration to the units of velocity and time. While the student initially exited the conversation, the recap reiterated the correct units and formula.

## Personalized Study Roadmap
Based on the session, the following areas require further study:
1. **Units of Measurement:** Review the standard units for kinematic quantities (displacement, velocity, acceleration) and their derivations. Practice converting between different units.
2. **Kinematics Problems:** Focus on problems involving uniform acceleration, paying close attention to initial conditions (rest, constant velocity). Recommended practice: Solve a variety of kinematics problems involving different scenarios (e.g., free fall, projectile motion).
3. **Conceptual Understanding of Acceleration:** Reinforce the understanding of acceleration as the rate of change of velocity. Visualize scenarios with changing velocity to develop intuition about acceleration. Resource Recommendation: Khan Academy's physics section on kinematics provides excellent explanations and practice problems.
