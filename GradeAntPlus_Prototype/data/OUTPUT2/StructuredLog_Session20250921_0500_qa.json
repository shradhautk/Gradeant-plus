  "session_summary": {
    "session_overview": "This session covered kinematics (specifically uniform acceleration) and basic capacitor concepts. The student demonstrated proficiency with the capacitor problem but struggled with the units of acceleration, initially providing an incorrect unit (m/s^3) instead of m/s^2. The session consisted of two questions. Overall performance indicates a need to reinforce fundamental physics definitions and unit conventions.",
    "key_concepts_and_formulas": "**Kinematics:**\n*   **Uniform Acceleration:** Acceleration is constant over time.\n*   **Definition of Acceleration:** Acceleration (a) is the rate of change of velocity (v) with respect to time (t): a = (v - u) / t, where 'u' is initial velocity.\n*   **Units of Acceleration:** meters per second squared (m/s^2).\n**Capacitors:**\n*   **Capacitance (C):** The ability of a capacitor to store electrical charge, measured in microfarads (µF).\n*   **Voltage (V):** The potential difference across the capacitor, measured in volts (V).\n*   **Charge (Q):** The amount of electrical charge stored in the capacitor, measured in microcoulombs (µC).\n*   **Formula:** Q = C * V",
    "common_misconceptions_addressed": "The primary misconception was using incorrect units for acceleration (m/s^3). This stems from a misunderstanding of the definition of acceleration as the *rate of change of velocity*. The correction strategy involved emphasizing that acceleration is the change in velocity (m/s) *per unit of time* (s), resulting in units of m/s^2. The analogy of a car's speedometer was used to illustrate the difference between velocity (speed) and acceleration (how quickly the speed is changing).",
    "areas_for_further_study": "1.  **Review Kinematics Definitions:** Revisit the definitions of displacement, velocity, and acceleration, with a strong focus on their units. Practice converting between different units.\n2.  **Practice Acceleration Problems:** Solve a variety of problems involving uniform and non-uniform acceleration. Pay close attention to unit conversions and ensure the final answer has the correct units.\n3.  **Units of Measurement:** Perform additional exercises focused on unit analysis and dimensional consistency to ensure correct units are applied to calculated values. This can be done by working through example problems and paying close attention to the units at each step of the calculation.\n4.  **Resource Recommendation:** Refer to introductory physics textbooks or online resources (e.g., Khan Academy, HyperPhysics) for additional explanations and practice problems on kinematics and units of measurement.\n5. **Deeper Dive:** Explore the relationship between kinematics and calculus (derivatives and integrals). This can help develop a more fundamental understanding of the concepts."
