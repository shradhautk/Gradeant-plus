## Learning Journey Overview
This session covered kinematics and basic capacitor principles, including calculating acceleration and charge. The student demonstrated understanding of applying formulas but struggled with the units of acceleration. The session consisted of two questions. The student demonstrated proficiency in applying the formula Q=CV, but exited after addressing units in kinematics.

## Physics Concepts & Formulas Mastered
Key concepts included: 1) Definition of acceleration as the rate of change of velocity (a = (v-u)/t), with attention to proper units (m/s^2). 2) Understanding the relationship between charge, capacitance, and voltage in a capacitor (Q = CV). Difficulty level: Beginner/Intermediate.

## Conceptual Breakthroughs & Misconceptions Resolved
The primary misconception addressed was the incorrect units for acceleration (m/s^3 instead of m/s^2). The root cause appears to be a lack of understanding of the fundamental definition of acceleration and its relation to velocity and time. The student needs to focus on unit conversions and dimensional analysis.

## Personalized Study Roadmap
The student should focus on: 1) Practicing kinematics problems involving uniform acceleration, with emphasis on correctly identifying and using units. 2) Reviewing the definitions of velocity and acceleration. Recommendation: Work through additional practice problems. Resource: Online physics simulations and tutorials. Further study should connect to broader physics curriculum by covering all kinematics equations and the effects of non-constant acceleration.
