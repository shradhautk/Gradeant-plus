What is a typical value for the amount of mixing per dpa (“replacements per atom”) for energetic displacement cascade conditions (>10 keV PKAs)?",
      "student_answer": "Recoil Implantation: Within 0.1 picoseconds, the PkAs transfer energy to recoils through collisions, the energized recoils are then implanted into a different part of the material.  This mechanism contributes the least to the variation in mixing, with the area of mixing being limited to < 1 nm^2/dpa.\n\nCascade Mixing: In about a picosecond, the secondary recoils from the original collisions cause further displacements that \"mix\" over a larger area.  The process continues until the atoms no longer possess enough energy to cause further displacements.  This mechanism covers an area of about 10 nm^2/dpa.\n\nThermal Spike: Over a couple picoseconds, the excess energy of the atoms is distributed across the surrounding atoms. The spike in average energy or temperature causes the atoms to diffuse along with the heat gradient.  This mechanism causes the mixing of the largest area at about 100 nm^2/dpa, and it is most important for massive ions.",
