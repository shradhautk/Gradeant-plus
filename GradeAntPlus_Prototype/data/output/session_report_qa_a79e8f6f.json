    "session_overview": "This session covered kinematics and basic capacitor calculations. The student demonstrated a good understanding of the formulas but struggled with units in the first question. They successfully applied the formula for charge in a capacitor.",
    "key_concepts_and_formulas": "Key concepts included: Acceleration (a = (v - u)/t), Capacitance (Q = CV), Units of measurement for acceleration (m/s^2), voltage (V), charge (µC) and capacitance (µF).",
    "common_misconceptions_addressed": "The primary misconception addressed was the incorrect unit for acceleration (m/s^3 instead of m/s^2). This indicates a need to reinforce the understanding of how units are derived from the physical quantities they represent.",
    "areas_for_further_study": "1. Review the definitions and units for common kinematic quantities like displacement, velocity, and acceleration. Pay close attention to how these units are derived from the formulas. 2. Practice unit conversions and dimensional analysis to ensure correct units are used in calculations. 3. Work through additional problems involving kinematics and capacitor circuits, focusing on correctly applying formulas and units."
