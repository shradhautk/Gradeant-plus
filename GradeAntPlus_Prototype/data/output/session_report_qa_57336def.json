  "session_summary": {
    "session_overview": "This session covered kinematics and capacitance, focusing on calculating acceleration and charge stored in a capacitor. The student demonstrated a good understanding of the formulas but initially struggled with the units of acceleration. They quickly corrected their mistake after a prompt.",
    "key_concepts_and_formulas": "Key concepts covered include: Acceleration (a = (v - u)/t), Capacitance (Q = CV), and the importance of using correct units. Formulas used were a = (v - u)/t for acceleration and Q = C * V for charge in a capacitor.",
    "common_misconceptions_addressed": "The primary misconception addressed was using incorrect units for acceleration (m/s^3 instead of m/s^2).",
    "areas_for_further_study": "To improve, the student should: 1) Review the standard units for common physics quantities (velocity, acceleration, force, energy, etc.). 2) Practice more kinematics problems involving different types of motion (constant velocity, constant acceleration). 3) Work on unit conversions to ensure consistent units are used in calculations."
