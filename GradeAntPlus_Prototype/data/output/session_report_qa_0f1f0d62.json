  "session_summary": {
    "session_overview": "This session covered kinematics (uniform acceleration) and basic capacitor concepts (charge, voltage, capacitance). The student demonstrated a strong understanding of the formulas and problem-solving techniques for the questions presented.",
    "key_concepts_and_formulas": "Key concepts covered include: Acceleration, Uniform acceleration, Kinematics, Capacitance, Voltage, Charge. Important formulas used were: a = (v - u)/t and Q = C * V.",
    "common_misconceptions_addressed": "No misconceptions were identified during this session. The student answered both questions correctly and demonstrated a solid understanding of the underlying principles.",
    "areas_for_further_study": "Since the student performed well, further study could focus on: 1) Exploring more complex kinematics problems involving non-uniform acceleration and projectile motion. 2) Investigating the energy stored in a capacitor and capacitor networks (series and parallel combinations)."
