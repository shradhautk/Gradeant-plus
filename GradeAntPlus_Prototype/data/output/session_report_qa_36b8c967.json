  "session_summary": {
    "session_overview": "This session covered concepts in kinematics and electrostatics, specifically acceleration and capacitance. The student demonstrated understanding of applying formulas but showed a weakness in understanding units of measurement for physical quantities.",
    "key_concepts_and_formulas": "Key concepts covered include: Acceleration (a = (v - u)/t), Capacitance (Q = CV), Units of measurement (m/s^2 for acceleration, µC for charge).",
    "common_misconceptions_addressed": "The primary misconception addressed was the incorrect use of units for acceleration. The student initially stated the acceleration in m/s^3 instead of m/s^2.",
    "areas_for_further_study": "1. Review the standard units of measurement for common physics quantities like velocity, acceleration, force, energy, and power. Pay close attention to the SI units and their derivations. 2. Practice unit conversions to ensure consistency within calculations. 3. Complete additional practice problems focusing on kinematics and electrostatics to reinforce both formula application and correct unit usage."
