  "session_summary": {
    "session_overview": "This session covered problems related to kinematics (specifically uniform acceleration) and capacitance. The student demonstrated understanding of the capacitance problem but initially struggled with the units in the acceleration problem, requiring a hint to correct their answer.",
    "key_concepts_and_formulas": "Key concepts covered include: Acceleration, Capacitance, Voltage, Charge, Units of measurement. Formulas used: a = (v - u)/t, Q = C * V",
    "common_misconceptions_addressed": "The primary misconception addressed was the incorrect use of units for acceleration (m/s^3 instead of m/s^2). This indicated a misunderstanding of what acceleration physically represents.",
    "areas_for_further_study": "1. Review the definitions and units of kinematic quantities, paying close attention to the physical meaning of each unit. 2. Practice unit conversions and dimensional analysis to ensure correct units are used in calculations. 3. Work through additional problems involving uniformly accelerated motion, focusing on interpreting the results in terms of changing velocity."
