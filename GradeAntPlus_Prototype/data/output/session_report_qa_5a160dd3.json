  "session_summary": {
    "session_overview": "The session covered two physics problems: one on kinematics (uniform acceleration) and another on electrostatics (capacitance). The student correctly applied the formulas in both cases but needed prompting regarding units and significant figures for the capacitance problem.",
    "key_concepts_and_formulas": "Key concepts included: Acceleration, Kinematics, Uniform acceleration, Capacitance, Voltage, Charge. Formulas used: a = (v - u)/t, Q = C * V",
    "common_misconceptions_addressed": "The primary issue identified was a lack of attention to detail regarding units and significant figures in calculations, especially within the context of electrostatics. While the student knew the correct formula (Q=CV) and plugged in the values correctly, they initially overlooked the importance of expressing the answer with the appropriate units (Coulombs) and the correct number of significant figures based on the given values.",
    "areas_for_further_study": "1. Review the rules for significant figures in calculations, particularly when multiplying or dividing values with different numbers of significant figures. Practice applying these rules in various physics problems.\n2. Practice unit conversions and pay close attention to the standard units used in physics formulas (e.g., converting microfarads to farads). Work through examples that require converting units before applying formulas.\n3. Do more problems involving electrostatics, focusing on clearly stating the units of each quantity and ensuring the final answer reflects the correct units and significant figures."
