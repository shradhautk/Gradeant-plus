    "session_overview": "This session covered basic kinematics and capacitance. The student demonstrated a good understanding of applying formulas but struggled with units in the first question.",
    "key_concepts_and_formulas": "Key concepts included: Acceleration (a = (v - u)/t), Capacitance (Q = CV), Units of measurement (m/s^2 for acceleration, µC for charge).",
    "common_misconceptions_addressed": "The student initially used incorrect units for acceleration (m/s^3 instead of m/s^2).",
    "areas_for_further_study": "1. Review the standard units of measurement for common physics quantities like acceleration, force, energy, and power. 2. Practice converting between different units (e.g., meters to kilometers, seconds to hours)."
