      "description": "Summarize the three major radiation mixing (ion-ion collision) mechanisms (also sometimes called ion beam mixing). What are the operative time frames for the different mechanisms? Which mechanism is typically most important for energetic massive ions? What is a typical value for the amount of mixing per dpa (“replacements per atom”) for energetic displacement cascade conditions (>10 keV PKAs)?",
      "reply": "7\n\nOlamide Olabiyi NE 6241 Homework #03\nQuestion 5.\nIon Beam mixing is an ion irradiation method used in the modification of metal surfaces so as to alter the composition of the target material.\n\nThe three major Ion Beam missing methods are as follows:\n• Recoil Implantation\n• Cascade Mixing\n• Thermal Spike\n\nRecoil Implantation\nThis occurs when an incoming ion beam hits a target sample of an atom and thereby imparting the momentum from the incoming ion to the atoms of the sample. However, the distribution of the momentum on the atoms is not uniform and the knock-on atoms end up being relocated in the beam direction based on preference.\n\nSince the target sample is a solid, there is an equilibrium in the overall movement of the atoms. The operative time frame for Recoil Implantation is in the order of 10⁻¹⁴ which is just the beginning of the radiation mixing process and it occurs rapidly beyond human eyes observation. Recoil implantation thereby has the least mixing effect for this reason.\n\nCascade Mixing\nIn this Ion Beam mixing technique, the energy transfer from the recoiling atoms from recoil implantation is rapid with the operative time frame being in the order of 10⁻¹³ seconds. The cascade mixing leads to effective uniformization of the mixing after recoil implantation which enhances the implantation of ion. The cascade propagation time is in of the order 10⁻¹⁴ and the quench time, is 10⁻¹² seconds.\n\nThis is also the mechanism that is most important for energetic massive ions.\nThe typical value for mixing per dpa for energetic displacement cascade conditions is in the range of 1-10 displacements per atom.\n\nThermal Spike\nThis is the most dominant component of radiation mixing. This is the point where the cascades from the cascade mixing begin to reduce and tend to randomly cause spikes or melting in random locations with the concentration of energy at such point. This will then lead to a more random mixing because of the spike in energy which enhances atomic mobility.\n\nThe operative time frame for this mechanism is in the order of 10⁻¹¹ seconds which is slower than both the recoil implantation and cascade mixing mechanisms but still fast enough beyond ordinary observation.\n8"
