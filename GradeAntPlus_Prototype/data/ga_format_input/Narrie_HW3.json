      "description": "5 MeV Al ions are used to irradiate an Al sample. Determine whether these conditions represent the “high-energy” or “low-energy” regime for electronic stopping/ionization interactions in solids by comparing the electron orbital velocity of the bound electrons (Eq. 2.49 in lecture notes section 2.3) with the ion velocity (Eq. 2.47 in lecture notes). Using the appropriate electronic stopping power approximation, calculate the ion energy as a function of distance from the surface and determine the approximate range of the Al ions in Al. (see textbook for a convenient approximate relationship between the distance traveled by the ion R and the projected range Rp).",
