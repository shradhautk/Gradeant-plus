ü§ñ GradeAnt+ Tutor: Okay, let's think about it this way. What are the individual components that make up the nucleus, and how do their masses relate to the mass of the nucleus itself? Specifically, what particles are in the nucleus, and what are their masses denoted by?

ü§ñ GradeAnt+ Tutor: Almost! Remember, only protons and neutrons are found in the nucleus. Electrons orbit the nucleus. So, focusing on the nucleus, how would you express the total mass of all the protons and neutrons separately, using the symbols 'p' for the mass of a proton and 'n' for the mass of a neutron, and also considering the number of protons (Z) and neutrons (N)?
Your response: Z+N

ü§ñ GradeAnt+ Tutor: You're getting there! Z and N represent the *number* of protons and neutrons. To get the total mass of all the protons, you need to multiply the number of protons (Z) by the mass of a single proton (p). Similarly, for neutrons. Can you express the total mass of all the protons and neutrons in terms of Z, p, N, and n?
Your response: Z*p+N8n

ü§ñ GradeAnt+ Tutor: Excellent! So, you have Z*p + N*n, which represents the total mass of the individual protons and neutrons. Now, how does this relate to the mass of the nucleus (M_nucleus) and the binding energy (BE)? Can you write an equation for BE in terms of Z, p, N, n, and M_nucleus? Remember that mass and energy are related by E=mc^2.
